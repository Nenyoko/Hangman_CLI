# Hangman_CLI

## What is that?
It's a little game we've coded to learn some things about C++.
You can compile it simply:
* **On Windows:**
You need [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/), open a terminal in the directory and type:
```bash
mingw32-make
```

(_Keep in mind that you can only play it in command line, dont try to open the .exe file_)
* **On Linux:** Open a terminal in the directory and type:
```bash
make
```
